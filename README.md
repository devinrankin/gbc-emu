A hobby GameBoy Color emulator I'm writing as an intermediate emulation project.

# To-Do
- Organize memory bank controllers into classes. (I think polymorphism is the best way to structure this)
- Write bank switching logic.
- Fix read/write on cartridge to match memory bank controller functionality.
